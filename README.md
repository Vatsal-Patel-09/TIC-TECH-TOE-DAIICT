## Chatbot for Gifting E-commerce Website
### Objective:
  Develop an AI-powered chatbot for an e-commerce gifting website that helps users select the perfect gift based on their preferences, occasion, recipient’s details, and budget. The chatbot should be user-friendly and able to guide the customer seamlessly through the gift selection process, ensuring a personalized shopping experience.
### Key Features & Requirements:
  1.	User Input Collection:
     The chatbot must gather relevant information from users to recommend the ideal gift. Example inputs include:
    ■	Occasion: Birthday, Wedding, Anniversary, Graduation, Festivals (e.g., Christmas, Diwali), etc.
    ■	Recipient Information: Age, Gender, Relationship to the user (e.g., friend, parent, partner, colleague, etc.).
    ■	Budget: Provide a price range or maximum spend.
    ■	User Preferences: Preferences such as gift type (e.g., personalized gifts, tech gadgets, fashion accessories, etc.), delivery preferences (e.g., same-day delivery, customization time).
  2.	Gift Recommendations:
     	Based on the user's inputs, the AI chatbot should suggest a curated list of gifts that best match the occasion, recipient’s characteristics, and budget.
     	Recommendations should be diverse, offering options in different categories (e.g., personalized, trending, best-sellers).
  3.	Interactive Experience:
     	The chatbot should be conversational and interactive, asking follow-up questions if needed (e.g., "Do you prefer personalized gifts?" or "Would you like to add a greeting card?").
     	The AI should handle clarifications, if the user is unsure or provides vague responses.
  4.	Seamless Shopping Experience:
     	Once the user selects a gift, the chatbot should guide them to complete the purchase process (e.g., "Would you like to proceed with the purchase?")
